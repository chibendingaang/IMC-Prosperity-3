## IMC-Prosperity-3
Algo trades developed by me and the team members of Equity Island in IMC Prosperity 3

## Description
Prosperity was a 15-day trading competition where players earned currency of seashells to grow their Archipelago across 5 rounds (each spanning 3 days). Multiple new products were introduced in each round, with unique properties resembling real-world assets. Products from previous rounds remain tradable, and finding and using alphas was crucial to obtain optimal strategies.

## Log:
We researched each product using sample data, then wrote and submitted Python scripts to perform systematic trades. Each round also included a manual trading challenge, typically centered around game theory and predicting other participants' decisions.

At the end of each round, both algorithmic and manual results were combined to give the island's PNL.
